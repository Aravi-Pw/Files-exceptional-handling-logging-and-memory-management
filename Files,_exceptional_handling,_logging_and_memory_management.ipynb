        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpreted Languages\n",
        "Code is executed line by line by an interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "No separate compilation step; the code runs directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Slower execution since the interpreter translates code at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples: Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby\n",
        "\n",
        "Compiled Languages\n",
        "Code is translated entirely into machine code by a compiler before execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "The compiled code (binary/executable) runs directly on the CPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "Faster execution since there's no interpretation at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples: C, C++, Rust, Go\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Both import and from ... import are used to bring external modules into a Python script, but they work differently in terms of namespace, efficiency, and readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Using import\n",
        "The import statement imports the entire module, and you must use the module name when accessing its functions or variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Using from ... import\n",
        "This imports specific functions or variables from a module, allowing direct usage without prefixing the module name.\n",

        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "Both multithreading and multiprocessing allow a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, but they work differently in terms of execution, performance, and resource utilization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading is the execution of multiple threads within the same process. Threads share the same memory space but run different tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "üîπ Uses Python's threading module\n",
        "üîπ Best for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file I/O, network requests)\n",
        "üîπ Threads share memory (less memory overhead)\n",
        "üîπ Limited by Python‚Äôs Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) ‚Üí Only one thread executes Python code at a time\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing is the execution of multiple processes, each with its own memory space. It takes full advantage of multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "üîπ Uses Python's multiprocessing module\n",
        "üîπ Best for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., mathematical computations, data processing)\n",

        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program\n",
        "\n",
        "Logging is an essential feature in programming that helps track and debug issues, monitor program execution, and store important runtime information. In Python, the logging module provides a flexible way to log messages at different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory management in Python is the process of efficiently allocating, tracking, and freeing memory automatically. Python uses a private heap space and built-in memory management techniques such as garbage collection and reference counting to manage memory efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is done using the try-except block to handle errors gracefully without stopping program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory management is crucial in Python to ensure efficient use of system resources, prevent memory leaks, and optimize performance.

        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's Garbage Collection (GC) system automatically manages memory by reclaiming unused objects, preventing memory leaks, and improving performance. It mainly relies on Reference Counting and Cyclic Garbage Collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the else block in exception handling is executed only if no exceptions occur in the try block. It allows you to separate the successful execution logic from error-handling logic, making your code cleaner and more readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python\n",
        "Python‚Äôs logging module provides several logging levels to categorize messages based on severity. These levels help developers track errors, debug issues, and monitor application performance.\n",

        "Useful when you need to process the entire file at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "file.readline()\n",
        "Reads one line at a time from the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each call to readline() moves the file pointer to the next line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Useful when reading large files line by line to save memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for\n",
        "\n",
